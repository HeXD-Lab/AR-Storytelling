Apollo, the god of light, music, prophecy, and healing, is one of the most revered figures in Greek mythology. Born to Zeus and Leto, he is often depicted as a youthful figure playing the lyre or holding a laurel wreath. Apollo embodies harmony and order and is associated with the sun's light as well as artistic inspiration. He is also known for his prophetic abilities at the Oracle of Delphi, where seekers would come to hear his divine insights. As a healer, Apollo represents not only physical health but also mental clarity and artistic expression. His twin sister is Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, emphasizing their complementary roles in nature.
