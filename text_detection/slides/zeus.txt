Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods in ancient Greek mythology, is revered as the god of the sky and thunder. Born to the Titans Cronus and Rhea, Zeus narrowly escaped being swallowed by his father, who feared a prophecy that one of his children would overthrow him. Instead, Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on Crete, where he grew strong and wise. Once he reached adulthood, Zeus freed his siblings from Cronus's stomach and led them in a ten-year war against the Titans, known as the Titanomachy. With the help of powerful allies like the Cyclopes, who forged his iconic thunderbolts, Zeus emerged victorious and established himself as the ruler of Mount Olympus. He is often depicted wielding a thunderbolt and is associated with symbols such as the eagle and oak tree. While Zeus is celebrated for maintaining order and justice among gods and mortals, he is also known for his numerous affairs and complex relationships, often leading to dramatic tales of vengeance and punishment. His reign was further challenged by formidable foes like Typhon, a monstrous giant whom Zeus defeated to secure his position as the supreme deity.
